# Railway-Train_Travel-Management-System

Via this Program, we intended to make the search for Trains easier for the user. The Program is based in C Language. The project incorporates the use of File Handling and Linked List data structure for searching and sorting of train and route data. The Project program involves a basic GUI wherein the user could choose from the destination and source and the timing to get the desired Details.
